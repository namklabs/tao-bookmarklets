#What is this?
This is a collection of jQuery-powered bookmarklets for the TaoCMS. They assist in many of the day-to-day tasks that can be cumbersome for developers who perform them many times over.

##Architecture
I think to start off I will have the master branch contain the finished bookmarks and the empty bookmark template. Other branches will be used for developing individual functions. Let's see how that goes.

##Bookmarklet List

- bookmarklet.js - blank template
- tao-select-search.js - makes select-dropdowns searchable by text input
- tao-move-item.js - opens a new window to let you move an item in a list up or down quickly
- tao-webpage-id.js - displays the id of each webpage in the webpage module page list
